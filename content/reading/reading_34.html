<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>Pielke has argued that we don’t have the technology necessary to abandon fossil fuels. Jacobson and Delucchi disagree and present a proposal here.</p>
<ul>
<li>“A path to sustainable energy” presents Jacobson and Delucchi’s proposal to the general public. “Low-cost solution to the grid reliabilty problem” (optional for undergrads) provides up-to-date technical details for implementing this plan in the US.</li>
<li>“Evaluation of a proposal” (optional for undergraduates) is a fierce critique by a group of scientists and engineers. Jacobson <em>et al.</em> reply to this critique in “The United States can keep the grid stable.” This exchange spawned a huge fight in the clean energy research community with accusations of dishonesty on all sides. The news stories “Fisticuffs” and “A bitter scientific debate” describe this fight.</li>
<li><p>As you read Jacobson and Delucchi’s proposal and its critics, think about both the technical and political aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are Jacobson and his co-authors persuasive when they argue that we have the technology that we need to quickly transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy?</li>
<li>If we do have the technology, what political obstacles would you see to implementing this proposal?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
