<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>Some key points to be sure you understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is the steady-state concentration of methane in the atmosphere related to the rate of methane emissions?</li>
<li>What are the largest natural and anthropogenic sources of methane? How does anthropogenic methane emission compare to natural emission?</li>
<li>What are the dominant anthropogenic sources of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</li>
<li>What do we know about the land as a sink for carbon?</li>
<li>What is CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization and how might it affect the role of the land as a carbon sink? What are the potential benefits to plants of higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and what constraints are there on the extent to which these benefits might be realized in practice?</li>
<li>Understand the ocean carbon sink. Where, specifically, does the ocean work effectively to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and how might this sink be affected by rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels?</li>
<li>What is <strong>ocean ventilation</strong>? Why is it important and how fast does it work?</li>
<li>What is the <strong>thermocline</strong> and why is it important to the ocean carbon sink?</li>
<li>Why would increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere make the oceans become more acidic? How confident can we be of predictions about ocean acidification?</li>
<li>What is <strong>buffering</strong> and how would it affect ocean acidification?</li>
<li>What is the biological pump in the oceans? Are there things people might do to speed up the biological pump</li>
<li>In the big picture, consider how these pieces fit together: how might rising temperatures and increasing drought around the world (two things scientists are very confident will happen as a result of rising greenhouse gas concentrations) affect the various carbon sources and sinks? How might ocean acidification affect the biological pump?</li>
</ul>
