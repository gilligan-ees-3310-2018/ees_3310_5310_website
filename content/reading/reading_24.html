<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>In both chapters, the focus is on what it would take to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around the world.</p>
<p>Key concepts that you should understand are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be discussing national and global energy consumption in terms of <strong>quads</strong> (see p. 63 in Climate Fix). You should have a good feeling for how much a quad is and how many quads the US consumes.</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Kaya Identity</strong> and the factors that go into it (p. 71 of <em>The Climate Fix</em>; you might also go back and quickly review pp. 19–23 of <em>Climate Casino</em>, which we read for Aug. 28).:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>)</li>
<li>Population (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>)</li>
<li>Per-capita GDP (<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>)</li>
<li>Energy intensity of the economy (<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>)</li>
<li>Carbon intensity of the energy supply (<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How would you make sense of the fact that the U.S. has a much greater <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> than India and a slightly smaller <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> than China, but a much smaller <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> than either India or China?</li>
<li>What trends have we seen over the past several decades in the energy intensity of the economy and the carbon intensity of the energy supply? (pp. 74–79 of <em>The Climate Fix</em> and Fig. 3 on p. 22 of <em>Climate Casino</em>)</li>
<li>What is <strong>primary energy consumption</strong> and how does it differ from other kinds of energy consumption?</li>
<li>Why does Pielke argue that <strong>energy dependence</strong> leads to <strong>energy insecurity</strong>?</li>
<li>In <em>Climate Casino</em>, look at Figure 23 and the table of carbon emissions on p. 159. How do different fuels compare in terms of carbon emissions?</li>
<li>In <em>Climate Casino</em>, look at Table 6 and get a sense of what activities cause the most CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</li>
<li><p>What does the Kaya Identity and the material from <em>Climate Casino</em> suggest for where we should focus in our economy to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</p></li>
