<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>Chapter 3 treats global warming as a scientific consequence of an economic problem. As you read, consider the following questions. Some have clear answers
while others are beyond the knowledge of experts and I ask them to challenge you to think about hard problems.
On p. 30, Nordhaus describes three components that drive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: population, per-capita GDP, and the carbon intensity of the economy. A mathematical expression for this relationship is known as the <strong>Kaya identity</strong>, and we will study this in great depth on Oct. 15–22 and in the lab project on decarbonizing the energy supply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why don’t free markets manage greenhouse gas emissions well?</li>
<li>Are CO<sub>2</sub> emissions going up or down? Why?</li>
<li>What is carbon intensity? Is it going up or down in the US? Why?</li>
<li>When Nordhaus writes about models for predicting future climate change, he distinguishes between <strong>predictions</strong> and
<strong>projections</strong>. What is the difference and why is it important?</li>
<li>Table 1 on p. 31 shows two projections of future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Why are they different? How can we tell which is a better prediction?</li>
<li>What is an <strong>integrated assessment model</strong> (<strong>IAM</strong>)?</li>
<li>What are the biggest sources of uncertainty in predicting future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions?</li>
<li>How much can we trust models of future climate change? What should we consider when deciding how much to trust a model?</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4 looks at what we do and don’t know about future climate change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages 37–42 are largely a review of material we studied in much greater depth
in the first few weeks of the term. You can read through it quickly.</li>
<li>What is the difference between <strong>transient</strong> and <strong>equilibrium</strong> response to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? What would we expect to happen
to the global temperature if everyone around the world completely stopped burning fossil fuels this afternoon?</li>
<li>Figure 9 shows several different projections for how temperature might change over the rest of this century. What is the biggest reason the
projections don’t all agree with each other?</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the bullet points on pp. 47–48.</li>
<li>How does Nordhaus recommend that we think about the uncertainties in predictions about the climate?</li>
<li>Given these uncertainties, can we trust climate models and can they be useful?</li>
</ul>
