<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The last hundred years: Focus on two things in particular:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the evidence that the planet has warmed significantly in the last century?</li>
<li>What is the evidence that human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The last thousand years: This gets into some very tricky and controversial material that was central to the infamous “climategate” scandal in 2009. I will not spend a huge amount of time on this, but I will attempt to explain in class what the controversy was about and why it isn’t nearly as big a deal as the media have made it out to be.</p>
<p>Some things to understand about the past millennium are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a <strong>proxy</strong> for ancient temperatures? What are examples of commonly used proxies?</li>
<li>What problems do scientists face trying to get past temperatures from proxies?</li>
<li>What were the <strong>Medieval Warm Period</strong> and the <strong>Little Ice Age</strong>? Roughly when did they happen? What are the big questions scientists have about them?</li>
</ul></li>
