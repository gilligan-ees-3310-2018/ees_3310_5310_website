<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>Focus on pp. 13–23 in <em>Understanding the Forecast</em>. You need to understand the calculations of the “bare-rock” model on pp. 19–23. The intermediate steps are not as important as two equations:
<span class="math display">\[
  F_{\text{out}} = F_{\text{in}}\quad\text{at equilibrium,}
\]</span>
and equation (3.1), which describes the bare-rock model:
<span class="math display">\[
  T_{\text{earth}} =
  \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1-\alpha)I_{\text{in}}}{4\epsilon\sigma}}
\]</span>
(Helpful hint: to take a fourth root easily with your calculator, just press the square root key twice.)</p>
<p>Questions to think about (<strong>not</strong> to write up and turn in):</p>
<ul>
<li>What is blackbody radiation? What is a “blackbody” anyway?</li>
<li>Why is it that the sun gives off visible light, but the earth does not?</li>
<li>When the earth absorbs energy from sunlight, where does the energy go initially?
Where is the final destination of that energy?</li>
<li>What is the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, and why is it important?</li>
<li>What does the Stefan-Boltzmann equation tell us would happen if the sun got hotter?
What would happen if the Earth got hotter?</li>
<li><p>Study table 3.1 on p. 23 of <em>Understanding the Forecast</em>
(ignore the column “<span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{1 layer}}\)</span>” because we don’t get
to that until later in the chapter.):</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the sunlight brighter on Venus than on Earth, and dimmer on Mars?</li>
<li>Why is the “bare-rock” temperature of Venus lower than Earth,
even though it gets more sunlight?</li>
<li>Why do you suppose the actual observed temperature at the surface of Venus
is so much hotter than the “bare rock” temperature?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the top of p. 20, why does Archer write,
<span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{out}} = F_{\text{in}}\)</span>?
What would happen if
<span class="math inline">\(F_{\text{out}} \ne F_{\text{in}}\)</span></li>
<li>Without getting bogged down in the details of the numbers,
why are the areas used to calculate the incoming and outgoing energy
fluxes different? (Figures 3.1 and 3.2 explain this)</li>
<li><p>If the sun got 5% brighter, approximately how many degrees warmer would
the earth become?</p></li>
</ul>
