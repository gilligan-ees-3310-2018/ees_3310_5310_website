## Research Project Presentations

On April 17--19, you will present your semester research project. Each student
will have 10 minutes to present your project: 

* The big question you were asking
* How you approached that question with an agent-based model
* What you learned from running experiments with your model.

## Research Project Paper

On April 24, you should turn in to your folder on Box a formal paper on your
project.
