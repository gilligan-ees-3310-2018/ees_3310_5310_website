## Research Project Draft Model Code
Turn in the following homework on Box by 11:59 pm on Thursday, Mar. 29:

* Draft NetLogo code for your model. This does not need to be
  perfect, but it should check without syntax errors and it shoudl run, even
  if there are problems with its behavior.
  The point is to check in on where you are with the coding so I can give you 
  feedback.
* A document describing what you're satisfied with and what problems you're 
  struggling with.
