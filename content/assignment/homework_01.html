<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>The exercises from Chapter 3, below, are not to do for the lab
but are homework exercises. You have a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can do the exercises out of the book like regular homework and
turn them in at the beginning of class on Wednesday, Sept. 5.</p></li>
<li><p>You can do them using RMarkdown and turn them by submitting them
electronically on GitHub by the start of class on Wednesday, Sept. 5.</p>
<p>To submit the homework electronically,</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept the assignment on GitHub Classroom at <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/mExzWHyQ" class="uri">https://classroom.github.com/a/mExzWHyQ</a></li>
<li>Clone a local copy of the file repository from github.</li>
<li>In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
<code>homework_01.Rmd</code>.</li>
<li>When you are done, knit your <code>.Rmd</code> file into a PDF or DOCX (Microsoft Word) file.</li>
<li>Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to <code>homework_01.Rmd</code>
and the new PDF or DOCX file) to your local git repository.</li>
<li><p>Push the changes from your local git repository to github.</p>
<p>The last changes that you push before the due date (start of class
on Wednesday, Sept. 5) will be graded.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It is your choice how to do them. Either way is acceptable and will get equal
credit.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Start at the top, at the boundary to sapce, and work downward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the boundary to space, <span class="math inline">\(I_{1,up} = (1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4\)</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>At the ground, <span class="math inline">\((1 - \alpha) I_{solar} + I_{1,down} = I_{ground,up}\)</span></p></li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4 = I_{1,up} = \sigma T_{1}^4\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4 \varepsilon \sigma = T_{1}^4\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T_{1} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{solar}}{4 \varepsilon \sigma}}\]</span></p>
<p>This is familiar, because it’s the same as the formula for the bare-rock temperature.</p>
<p>Here is R code to calculate <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{1,up}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>I_1_up = (1 - alpha) * I_solar / 4
T_1 = (I_1_up / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25</code></pre>
<p>From the algebraic solution, we expect T<sub>1</sub> to be 254. K.
From the R code above, we get T<sub>1</sub> = 254. K.</p>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Now insert the value you found for T<sub>1</sub> into the budget for atmospheric

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(I_{ground} = I_{1,up} + I_{1,down} = 2 \times I_{1,up}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \sigma T_{ground}^4 = 2 \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T_{ground}^4 = 2 T_{1}^4\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T_{ground} = \sqrt[4]{2} \times T_{1}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>And here is R code to calculate <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{1,down}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{ground}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_{\text{ground}}\)</span>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>I_1_down = I_1_up
I_ground = I_1_up + I_1_down
T_ground = (I_ground / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25</code></pre>
<p>From the algebraic solution, we get T<sub>ground</sub> = 302. K and from the R code above, we get T<sub>ground</sub> = 302. K.</p>

<h2>Exercise 3.1 (Grad. students only)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The moon with no heat transport.</strong> The Layer Model assumes that the
temperature of the body in space is all the same. This is not really very
accurate, as you know that it is colder at the poles than it is at the equator.
For a bare rock with no atmosphere or ocean, like the moon, the situation is
even worse because fluids like air and water are how heat is carried around on
the planet. So let us make the other extreme assumption, that there is no heat
transport on a bare rock like the moon. Assume for comparability that the
albedo of this world is 0.30, same as Earth’s.</p>
<p>What is the equilibrium temperature of the surface of the moon, on the equator,
at local noon, when the sun is directly overhead? (Hint: First figure out the
intensity of the local solar radiation I<sub>solar</sub>)</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear Winter.</strong> Let us go back to the One-Layer Model but change it so
that the atmospheric layer absorbs visible light rather than allowing it to
pass through (See the figure above). This could happen if the upper atmosphere
were filled with dust. For simplicity, assume that the albedo of the Earth
remains the same, even though in the real world it might change with a dusty
atmosphere.&gt; What is the temperature of the ground in this case?</p>
