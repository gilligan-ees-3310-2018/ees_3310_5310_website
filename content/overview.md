## Catalog Description

**EES 3310/5310 Global Climate Change**
Scientific principles and policy applications. Earth's past; evidence of human
impact; future climate change; and economic, social, and ecological
consequences. Economic, technological, and public policy responses.

### Prerequisites

Prerequisite: one of 1030, 1080, 1510, 1510, CHEM 1601, ECON 1010, ES 1401 or
PHYS 1501, 1601, 1901. \[4\] \(MNS\)

Essentially, the pre-requisite is there to ensure that you are comfortable
with quantitative methods in natural or social science or engineering.
I expect you to be comfortable with using algebra to solve problems and that
you are familiar with basic statistics.

The course does not expect calculus or advanced math.

If you believe that you have these skills, but have not taken one of the
pre-requisites, please see me and I will be happy to make an exception.

### Repeat Credit

Repeat credit for 2110. Students who have earned credit for 2110 will earn only
one credit hour for this course.

## Narrative Description

This course will study earth's climate and the way it has changed throughout
our planet's history. We will study:

* Determinants of climate: What factors affect climate, how do we know this,
  and how certain are we?
* Scientific evidence about past climates: What do we know, how do we know it,
  and how certain are we?
* Natural climate change in earth's history.
* Effects of human activity on global climate in the last 200 years.
* What do we know about future climate change and how will it affect the
  quality of people's lives?
* How do economists and political scientists assess the costs of climate change
  and the value of policies to limit it?
* What can we do to mitigate future global climate change or adapt to life in a
  different climate?
* What is happening politically, both in the U.S. and internationally, to
  respond to climate change?

## Goals for the Course

My goals for this course are that at the end of the semester:

* You will have a solid quantitative understanding of the basic physical and
  chemical principles that control the system and be able to apply that
  knowledge to reasoning about the climate system and its response to
  disturbances.
* You will have working familiarity with a variety of computer models that
  simulate various aspects of the climate system and be able to use those
  models to explore the implications of scientific principles that are too
  complex to calculate with pencil and paper.
* You will have a solid scientific understanding of what scientists know, what
  they don’t know, and how they know what they know about how climate works,
  how and why it has changed in the past, and how it may change in the future.
* You will be able to evaluate the evidence for and against the idea that human
  activity is warming the planet and assess for yourself whether the evidence
  is persuasive.
* You will be familiar with the ways economists and policy analysts approach
  the problem of climate change and public policies that respond to it.
* You will understand the history of scientific and political concern and
  activity around global warming, the principal policy measures being
  considered to address climate change, and their major strengths and
  weaknesses.
* You will have the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions about what
  climate policies you support or oppose.
* In the laboratory, you will learn to:
    * Use simple climate models to explore the dynamics of the climate system.
    * Use open-source statistical tools to download and analyze real climate data.
    * Follow established reproducible research practices.

When you leave this course, you will not be qualified to work as a climate
scientist, but you will be able to follow and critically evaluate news
reporting about climate change and climate policy, debate intelligently and
knowledgeably, and be an informed voter.

I do not care whether you agree with me politically. I respect people who think
for themselves.
**What counts is whether you can present your own position clearly and support
it with solid evidence and reasoned argument.**

# **Structure of the Course:**

I divide the semester into two parts:

1. **Scientific Principles of Climate:** For the first half of the semester, we
   will focus on the scientific principles of climate and natural climate
   change in earth’s past. This will be very mathematical, using basic algebra.
   We do not use calculus or other advanced math in this class, but you should
   be comfortable with simple algebraic equations. We will then look at climate
   change in the last two centuries and what might happen over the next several
   centuries. We will emphasize examining the scientific evidence to understand
   what it can and cannot tell us.
2. **Human Dimensions of Climate Change: Politics, Economics, etc.:** For the
   second half of the semester, we will focus on the political, economic, and
   social aspects of climate change and possible public policy and
   technological responses.

## Laboratory

The laboratory section of this course is very important. In the first half of
the semester, you will use interactive computer models of the climate system to
explore the implications of principles that we cover in class and in the
reading, practice downloading and analyzing real climate data, and learning
about best practices for reproducible research in order to make your work
reliable, reproducible, and trustworthy. In the second half, you will use
computational tools to explore the challenges of replacing fossil fuels with
clean energy (renewable or nuclear), conduct quantitative economic analyses of
different kinds of climate policies, and engage in role-playing exercises to
simulate the way different climate policies work in practice.

To make the laboratory sessions effective, it is essential that you show up on
time and prepared for the labs.

# Reading Material

There are three required textbooks. Supplementary reading on the Internet or in
handouts will also be assigned during the term and posted on the course web
site.

## Required Reading Materials

* {{% LONG_ARCHER %}}
  Be sure you get the second edition because it is significantly different
  from the first.
* {{% LONG_NORDHAUS %}}
* {{% LONG_PIELKE %}}

There is a companion web site to {{% MEDIUM_ARCHER %}} at
[climatemodels.uchicago.edu](https://climatemodels.uchicago.edu),
which includes interactive online computer models that we will use for some
exercises in the book.

## Overview of Reading Materials

I will give out detailed reading that give specific pages to read for each class
and notes on important things you should understand. **I expect you to complete
the reading before you come to class on the day for which the reading is
assigned**, so you can participate in discussions of the assigned material and
ask questions if there are things you don’t understand.

While science aims to give correct answers to scientific questions, there are
not right or wrong answers to questions of what is the best economic model with
which to assess the costs of climate change or the best policy with which to
respond to climate change, so I have chosen books and other reading material
that present different points of view on the political and economic aspects.

## Class Web Site

In addition to the {{% BRIGHTSPACE %}} web site, I have set up a server at
{{% CLASS_WEB_SITE %}},
where I post the web versions of class slides and interactive web-based
applications to that can be useful for working with data output from agent-based
modeling experiments.

## Computer Software

For the laboratory, we will use four principal software tools:

* **{{% RSTATS %}}** is a powerful tool for statistical analysis.
* **{{% RSTUDIO %}}** provides an interactive environment for
  working with R. Using {{% RSTUDIO %}} makes R much more user-friendly and
  easy to work with.
* **{{% GIT %}}** is a tool that helps you manage your work by keeping track of the
  changes you make as you write and edit text and analysis code, and it also
  helps you easily back up your work and synchronize it across multiple
  computers, including coordinating working together with a partner.

    {{% GIT %}} integrates into RStudio, which makes it easier to use.

    We will also use a web-based service called **{{% GITHUB %}}**, which lets you
    easily save your work in the cloud (useful for backing it up in case
    something happens to your computer). {{% GITHUB %}} is free for
    open-source software projects, and students can also get a free account for
    class work and personal projects.

* **{{% LATEX %}}** is a powerful typesetting tool. You won't use this directly,
  but RMarkdown uses it behind the scenes to produce PDF documents.
  RMarkdown also allows you to produce web pages, and Word documents so
  using {{% LATEX %}} will be optional for this course.

Details about the software and how to install it are included in the
documentation for the first laboratory session.

Part of the assignment for the first lab is to install the necessary software
({{% RSTATS %}}, {{% RSTUDIO %}}, and {{% GIT %}}) on your computer before the
first lab, so please read the lab instructions and get an early start on this.

# **Assignments**

### Overview of reading assignments

I will give out detailed reading that give specific pages to read for each class
and notes on important things you should understand.
**I expect you to complete the reading before you come to class on the day
for which the reading is assigned**,
so you can participate in discussions of the
assigned material and ask questions if there are things you don't understand.

### **Lab Assignments**

Lab assignments have two parts: First, there will be reading and sometimes
some simple exercises or activities to do **before you come to lab** and then
there will be a write-up due after the lab (typically, it will be due on the
Monday morning one week after your lab session).

The instructions for the lab will be posted on the class web site a week before
the lab, and an assignment will be posted on {{% GITHUB %}}.
The **instructions**
explain the lab and tell you how to prepare for it. The **assignment** tells
you what to do and provides an RMarkdown template for your write-up.

### Tests and Examinations

There will be a fifty-minute closed-book midterm exam on {{% MIDTERM_DATE %}},
which will focus on your understanding of the science of climate and climate
change, and an open-book take-home essay final exam at the end of the semester
that will be due on {{% FINAL_EXAM_DATE %}}

## **Basis for Grading**

|                       |       |      |
|:---------------------:|------:|-----:|
| Class participation   |  5%   |      |
| Midterm Exam          | 30%   |      |
| Laboratory & Homework | 33%   |      |
| Final Exam            | 32%   |      |


# **Final Note:**

I have made every effort to plan a busy, exciting, and instructive semester.
I may find during the term that I need to revise the syllabus to give more time
to some subjects or to pass more quickly over others rather than covering them
in depth.
Thus, while I will attempt to follow this syllabus as closely as I can,
you should realize that it is subject to change during the semester.
