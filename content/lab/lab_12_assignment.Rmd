You and a partner will pick a country and begin working on a policy analysis for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.

## Important Update

The original assignment said to analyze **both** the 2030 goal for the Paris nationally determined contribution **and** the 2050 goal that you choose. 

I have decided that is too much work, so you should **only** do the analysis of how the country would achieve the **2050** goal that you choose (you **do not** have to analyze the difficulty of meeting the 2030 goal).

## Reading

**Before you come to lab**, please read the following document:
