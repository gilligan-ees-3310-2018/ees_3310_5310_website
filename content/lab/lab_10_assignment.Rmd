This week, you will continue analyzing decarbonization policy, but this time you will use what's called a "top-down" approach in which you assume the rates of growth of population and the economy from macroeconomic models, and then figure out what rate of decarbonization is implied by various policy goals.

Note that the due date for the report is in two weeks, not one week.
