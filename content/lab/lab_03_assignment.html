<p>This lab will use the MODTRAN computer model to simulate the transmission of different wavelengths of infrared light through the atmosphere and explore the effect that different greenhouse gases have on infrared light and the earth’s temperature.</p>
<p>There are two files for this lab.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start by reading <code>Lab_03_instructions.pdf</code>, which describes things you need
to know for this lab (about the R functions for working with the MODTRAN model
and the data that it produces, as well as some useful R functions that we will
use in procesing and graphing data for this lab.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This file also has the exercises you will do for this lab.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
edit the file <code>Lab_03_exercises.Rmd</code> to write your answers and show your
work.</li>
</ol>
